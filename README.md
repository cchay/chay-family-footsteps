# chay-family-footsteps
Futuristic post-apocaliptic RPG text game.

Setting:
In the year 2891, a global nuclear/EMP war had torn the world apart and sent the world civilization into the middle ages.  Nobody seems to know who had started the war.  All that is known is that mankind is now reliving the Dark Ages.  Although there are some remnants of technology still in existence, they are very rare.  Humans, being humans, have resorted to medieval warfare in groups of small clusters of towns.
