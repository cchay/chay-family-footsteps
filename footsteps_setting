2891, January 17.

A nuclear/EMP ripped apart the world we once knew as home, leaving little or nothing left of modern life, let alone electricity. We had but no choice to relive the Dark Days of the once-past medieval ways, resorting to using primitive tools and weapons to survive. Some remnants of modern technology somehow made it through, but their whereabouts are unknown. Those left alive are forced to join groups or clans in order to defeat hostile forces, and soon, the Black Knight.

Welcome to Footsteps...
